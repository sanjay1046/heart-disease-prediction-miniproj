# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Hybrid Machine Learning & Metaheuristic Algorithms

This project aims to refine heart disease prediction accuracy by combining classical machine learning models with novel, nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization techniques. Developed as part of the **CSE300 Mini Project** at **SASTRA Deemed University**, it focuses on smart feature selection, robust modeling, and advanced parameter tuning for optimal performance.
